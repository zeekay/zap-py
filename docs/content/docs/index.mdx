# ZAP Python

ZAP (Zero-Copy App Proto) is a high-performance RPC framework for building AI agent communication systems in Python.

## Key Features

- **FastMCP-Style API**: Decorator-based registration for tools, resources, and prompts
- **Zero-Copy Performance**: Built on ZAP for minimal serialization overhead
- **Async-First**: Full async/await support throughout the API
- **Post-Quantum Security**: ML-KEM-768 and ML-DSA-65 cryptography
- **W3C DID Support**: Decentralized identity for agent authentication
- **Agent Consensus**: Voting-based response aggregation for multi-agent systems

## Quick Example

```python
from zap import ZAP

app = ZAP("my-agent")

@app.tool
def search(query: str) -> list[str]:
    """Search for content"""
    return [f"Found: {query}"]

@app.resource("file://{path}")
def read_file(path: str) -> str:
    """Read a file from disk"""
    return open(path).read()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

## Why ZAP?

Traditional RPC frameworks serialize data multiple times during transmission. ZAP uses ZAP's zero-copy deserialization to eliminate this overhead, making it ideal for high-throughput AI agent communication.

Combined with post-quantum cryptography and W3C DID support, ZAP provides a secure foundation for building distributed AI systems.
